# Game of Life

This is the submission for Honeywell intern conversion hackathon. 
Conway's Game of Life is a problem which is related to cell evolution, in which cells die due to overpopulation or underpopulation or remain alive in next generation. Where as the dead cells may also become live with favourable conditions. Moree details can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

## Steps to run the program
1. Run the program by :python game_of_life.py
2. Enter the initial grid size (grid will automatically expand if required afterwards)
3. Enter the initial alive cells in the given interactive UI and click on "Start game of life".

5. after the evolution is completed (no live cells) or after first 25 generations , the animation will be stored in animation folder which can be seen.
